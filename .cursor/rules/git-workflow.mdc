# GIT WORKFLOW RULES

## Branch Strategy
- ✅ All commits **must** be made directly to the `main` branch.
- 🚫 Feature branches are **prohibited**.
- ✅ Background Agent commits **do not require pull requests**.
- ✅ Direct push to main is the **only accepted workflow**.

## Commit Rules
- ✅ Commit messages **must** be clear and descriptive, and written in English.
- ✅ Use the format: `feat: description`, `fix: description`, or `docs: description`.
- ✅ Each **logical change** should be a separate commit.
- 🚫 Never commit with vague messages like `"update"` or `"fix"` without context.

## Push Policy
- ✅ Always pull before pushing: `git pull origin main`.
- ✅ Push **immediately** after committing.
- 🚫 Do **not** leave local commits unpushed.

## Workflow Steps
1. ✅ Make sure you are on the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
2.	✅ Pull the latest changes:
git pull origin main
3.	✅ Make your changes and stage them:
git add .
4.  ✅ Commit with a clear message:
git commit -m "feat: short but descriptive summary"
	5.	✅ Push your work:
git push origin main

PROHIBITED ❌
	•	Creating or using any other branch than main
	•	Keeping local changes without committing
	•	Using git rebase or git commit --amend in shared history
	•	Force-pushing unless explicitly required by lead developer

✅ REMEMBER: Everything happens on the main branch — always clean, always up-to-date.
