# GIT WORKFLOW RULES

## Branch Strategy
- **ALL commits MUST be made directly to the `main` branch**
- Feature branches are PROHIBITED
- No pull requests required for Background Agent commits
- Direct push to main is the standard workflow

## Commit Rules
- Commit messages must be descriptive and in English
- Format: `feat: description` or `fix: description` or `docs: description`
- Each logical change should be a separate commit
- Never commit with generic messages like "update" or "fix"

## Push Policy
- Always pull before push: `git pull origin main`
- Push immediately after commit
- Never leave local commits unpushed

## Workflow Steps
1. Ensure you're on main: `git checkout main`
2. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
3. Make changes
4. Add files: `git add .`
5. Commit: `git commit -m "feat: descriptive message"`
6. Push: `git push origin main`

## PROHIBITED
- Creating new branches
- Working on branches other than main
- Keeping local changes without committing
- Squashing or rebasing commits

âœ… REMEMBER: All work happens directly on main branch!
