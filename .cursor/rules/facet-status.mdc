# FACET STATUS STRUCTURE
Each facet must be tracked with a dedicated JSON file placed in `/status/{FacetName}.json`

## Format:
```json
{
  "facet": "ExampleFacet",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS", // or: BUILD_READY, NEEDS_REVIEW, BLOCKED
  "testCoverage": 100,
  "multiUserTested": true,
  "checklistComplete": true,
  "gasSnapshotTakenAt": "2025-07-18T19:00:00Z",
  "abiGenerated": true,
  "facetMapLinked": true
}
```

- `status` must be changed manually by the Background Agent after test validation
- `gasSnapshotTakenAt` must use UTC ISO format
- Only `BUILD_READY` facets will be included in mainnet deployment plans
