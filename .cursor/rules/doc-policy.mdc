# Facet Documentation Rules

Each facet must have 2 docs:
- English version: `docs/facets/en/FacetName.md`
- Turkish version: `docs/facets/tr/FacetName.md`

## Must include:
- Facet purpose (1â€“3 sentence summary)
- List of all external/public functions (name, args, return, visibility)
- Storage structure explained
- Access rules
- Events emitted
- Example interaction (per language)

Use consistent headings:
Purpose
Functions
Access Control
Storage
Events
