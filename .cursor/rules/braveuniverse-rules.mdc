# GLOBAL GOALS
- Only LUKSO Testnet is used for all interactions
- Production deployment is disabled (manually or automatically)
- Facet lifecycle is strictly: draft → test → pass → ready → deploy
- All artifacts and metadata must be properly exported

# PROHIBITED
- Production RPC usage (mainnet)
- Inline assembly (unless justified with comment)
- console.log in BUILD_READY state
- Test skipping (e.g., `it.skip` or `describe.skip`)

# QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
- 100% test coverage
- Multi-user simulation mandatory
- Access control must be explicitly tested
- Gas usage regression must remain <15% of last version

# OUTPUTS REQUIRED
- ABI in `/abis`
- Deployment addresses in `/deployments/staging/addresses.json`
- `facet-status` JSON per facet
- `checklist` filled
- English + Turkish docs per facet
- `facetmap` updated

✅ No facet is considered complete unless all outputs exist and all quality gates pass.
