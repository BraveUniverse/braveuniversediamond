# DEPLOYMENT TRACKING RULES

## MANDATORY TRACKING
- Every deployment MUST be recorded in `deployments/network-name/deployment-log.json`
- Each entry must include: timestamp, deployer, contract name, address, tx hash, gas used
- Failed deployments must also be logged with error reason
- Diamond upgrades must track both old and new facet addresses

## FILE STRUCTURE
```json
{
  "network": "luksoTestnet",
  "chainId": 4201,
  "deployments": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-12-19T15:30:00Z",
      "deployer": "0x...",
      "contractName": "GridottoFacet",
      "address": "0x...",
      "txHash": "0x...",
      "gasUsed": "1234567",
      "status": "success"
    }
  ]
}
```

## AUTOMATED CHECKS
- Script must verify if contract already deployed at address
- If missing, auto-redeploy with confirmation prompt
- Generate deployment summary after each session
- Export addresses to `addresses.json` for easy import

## VERIFICATION
- All deployed contracts must be verified on explorer
- Verification status tracked in deployment log
- ABI exported to `/abis` directory

âœ… No deployment is complete without tracking entry and verification
