# FACETMAP STRUCTURE

Each facet must be registered under a domain in the main architecture file located at:
`/facetmap/BraveUniverse-map.json`

## Format:
```json
{
  "core": ["Diamond", "DiamondCutFacet", "DiamondLoupeFacet"],
  "ownership": ["OwnershipFacet"],
  "games": ["GridottoFacet", "SpaceCannonFacet"]
}
```

- Categories (`core`, `ownership`, `games`, etc.) are expandable.
- Each facet name must match the actual `.sol` file name.
- When a facet is created or removed, the facetmap must be updated.

âœ… Required before `BUILD_READY` state.
