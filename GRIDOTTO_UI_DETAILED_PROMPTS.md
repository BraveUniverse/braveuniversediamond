# ðŸŽ¯ Gridotto UI - Detailed Implementation Prompts

## 1. Contract Integration Prompts

### Update useGridottoContract Hook
```
Prompt: "I need to update the useGridottoContract hook to support multiple facets. The hook should:

1. Keep all existing methods for backward compatibility
2. Add new methods that call different facets:
   - Phase3Facet for: createTokenDraw, createNFTDraw, buyTokenDrawTicket, claimTokenPrize, claimNFTPrize
   - Phase4Facet for: createAdvancedDraw, getDrawTiers
   - AdminFacet for: setFees, banUser, withdrawProfit

The hook should determine which facet to use based on the method being called. Use the existing Web3 instance and error handling patterns.

Example structure:
const createTokenDraw = async (params) => {
  const phase3Contract = new web3.eth.Contract(PHASE3_ABI, PHASE3_ADDRESS);
  return await phase3Contract.methods.createTokenDraw(...).send({ from: account });
}"
```
