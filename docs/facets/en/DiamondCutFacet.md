# Facet: DiamondCutFacet

### Purpose
Provides functionality to add, replace, and remove facets and their functions from the Diamond. This is the core upgrade mechanism for the Diamond proxy pattern, enabling modular contract evolution while maintaining state.

### Functions
- `diamondCut(FacetCut[] memory _diamondCut, address _init, bytes memory _calldata)` â€” Executes diamond cuts to modify facets. Can add new functions, replace existing ones, or remove functions from the Diamond.

### Access Control
- Only the contract owner can execute diamond cuts
- Protected by the `enforceIsContractOwner()` modifier from LibDiamond
- Critical for Diamond security as it controls all upgrade functionality

### Storage
Uses `LibDiamond` for Diamond storage management. No additional storage library required as it operates directly on the core Diamond storage structure.
